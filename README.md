This is the HTML5 presentation for [¿Mas Bebes?][] started during the Mozilla
and Independent Television Service (ITVS) [Living Docs sprint]() on
October 12-13, 2011 in San Francisco.

## About The Film

¿Más Bebés? reveals the forgotten history of Mexican American women who were
coercively sterilized at L.A. County-USC Medical Center during the late 1960s
and 70s. Many spoke no English, and were prodded into tubal ligations during
the late stages of labor, often based on little more than the question “More
babies?”
